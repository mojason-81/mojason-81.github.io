### Frogger (clone) Game

This is an in-browser game that runs on JavaScript

#### Browser requirements.

Successfully tested using up-to-date versions of Chrome and Firefox (as of 17 Jan 2016).

#### To run the game.

Simply open `index.html` from the root directory in your browser.
You can also type the complete path into the address bar of your browser.
  i.e. `/home/jason/projects/frogger/index.html`
  If for some reason, that doesn't work, try preceding the path with `'file://'` as follows:
    `file:///home/jason/projects/frogger/index.html`

### How to play

Using the direction keys on your keyboard, move your character toward the water at the top
of the game board.  You get 3 lives.  After being hit by a bug, you will lose a life and you
will lose any points you earned on that particular try.  Collect items on the board and reach
the water to increase your score.  After losing all 3 lives, your score is set to 0.
